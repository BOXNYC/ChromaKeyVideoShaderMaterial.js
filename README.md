A bunch of Three.js stuff <3

### ChromaKey "Green Screen" Video Shader Material
This material is based on the AFRAME version on github. I don't use AFRAME unless nessesary, and I also created a cast shadow material which is the same, but tansparent black pixels. Pretty sweet.

### Hologram
Create video plane green screen holograms using the ChromaKey material above as well as a shadow. Has a bunch of eas-of-use scripts for making holograms super fast and easy. Best to use with WebAR.

### TapToPlace Mesh
This is another WebAR helper that quickly allows you to create a message for the user to know to tap their camera feed to spawn a model or hologram. Cool.
