# Three.js-Extras
A bunch of Three.js stuff <3


## Cool things for WebAR
### Hologram

### ChromaKey "Green Screen" Video Shader Material
This material is based on the AFRAME version on github. I don't use AFRAME unless nessesary, and I also created a cast shadow material which is the same, but tansparent black pixels. Pretty sweet.
